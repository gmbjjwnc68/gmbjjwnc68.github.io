      <p>"I've known Scott personally for over 10 years. In the last 6 months, I have gotten to know Scott as the professor at GMBJJWNC. He is a caring and strong leader who will help you advance in your bjj journey. Scott leads the academy from the front and is always there in a hands on way to help develop all of his students in both the kids and adult curriculums. I highly recommend GMBJJWNC to anyone interested in bettering thier health in all aspects and learning the art of jiu-jitsu. Not to mention the confidence you gain by knowing you can adequately defend yourself. This academy is clean, inviting, and every student is friendly and welcoming. I look forward to gaining new friendships and training partners in the future who want to become a part of our team family."</p>

      <p>"When I first came to a class, I was welcomed and felt like I belonged right from the start. The students look out for each other and really help drive the principles taught. Professor Scott will encourage you to push yourself and grow. His knowledge and experience is weighty and lends to easy-to-understand classes. One of the best decisions I ever made was stepping on those mats."</p>

      <p>"I started training at the Gustavo Machado BJJ Academy in Wilson around June of 2020. I had no prior knowledge of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu before I started and had no idea how it was going to impact my life. I was searching for a way to protect myself and found something that has transformed my whole world. In the beginning, I would constantly feel anxious and uncomfortable before stepping on the mat. It was intimidating being one of the few female students but somehow I turned it into a positive experience and it gave me strength. When I am scared, tired, or simply having a bad day, Jiu Jitsu has given me the confidence and discipline needed to overcome these obstacles and more!  Honestly, this is one of the best things that has happened to me. Joining a phenomenal family filled with good people has truly changed my life. If you have any hesitations: put them behind you, come be a part of a great team, and it will help you reach your full potential."</p>

      <p>"I started bjj to make me a better cage fighter. I train at Gustavo Machado Wilson branch because of the people; we all work hard and push each other to get better and achieve our goals, whether it’s to use bjj to get into shape or if you want to be an active competitor. We are a tight knit family, and that’s thanks to our coach Scott Bass; he is one hell of a leader and family man, and a different kind of animal when he is on the mats. I can’t see myself training anywhere else, and can’t wait to see what our team does in the years to come."</p>

      <p>"My daughter has only been going 3 months. In just that short amount of time I have seen a huge change in her schooling, self-esteem and confidence. She absolutely loves going. It’s all she talks about. She is just a happier, healthier child all the way around. Scott has done a wonderful job teaching them not only the basics of jiu-jitsu and how to defend themselves against bullies, but to have self confidence in the every day world. Highly recommend them not only for your kids, but the whole family."</p>
